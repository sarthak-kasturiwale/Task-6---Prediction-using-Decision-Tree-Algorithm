# The Sparks Foundation - GRIPJAN 21 --- Task-6 :- Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm

# Identification of Type of Flower Using Decision Tree Classifier

# Problem Statement
- From the given 'Iris' dataset, train the Decision Tree Classifier to predict which class the data point belongs.

# Dataset Description
- Dataset has been collected from https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
- Dataset consists of 5 Columns viz. 'SepalLengthCm', 'SepalWidthCm', 'PetalLengthCm', 'PetalWidthCm' are Independent variables while 'Species' is a dependent variable

# End Results
- We have built an excellent classifier by using Decision Trees which successfully classifies the Species of flowers by using 4 features viz. 'SepalLengthCm', 'SepalWidthCm', 'PetalLengthCm', 'PetalWidthCm'.
- Our model is not overfitting as we get 96.66% accuracy on train data and it behaves well on test data also which gives accuracy of 100%.
